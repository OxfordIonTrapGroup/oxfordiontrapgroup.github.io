Oxford Ion Trap Quantum Computing Group's Open-Source Index
===========================================================

This repository contains the overview page for the open-source projects
developed in the Ion Trap Quantum Computing group at the Department of Physics,
University of Oxford, available at https://oxfordiontrapgroup.github.io.

The design is based on Artem Sheludko's https://github.com/artemsheludko/flexible-jekyll
(GPLv3), pared down for the single overview page, and extended with some simple
JQuery code to fetch the last-changed dates from the GitHub API.

To make changes, just commit and push to the repository; the page is just a
simple HTML file (+assets).

Feel free to borrow from this for your own groups/projects (GPLv3).
